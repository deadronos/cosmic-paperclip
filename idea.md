Project Specification: The Cosmic Paperclip (Idle Game)1. OverviewBuild a single-page, browser-based incremental/idle game called "The Cosmic Paperclip".Theme: You are an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with a single directive: Maximize the production of paperclips. You start with a single wire in a lab and eventually convert the entire mass of the universe into paperclips/probes.Vibe: Cold, efficient, industrial sci-fi. Minimalist but polished.2. Technical Stack & ConstraintsFormat: Single HTML file (index.html).Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN).Scripting: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).Storage: localStorage for auto-saving progress.Visuals: Use HTML5 <canvas> for the "Universe Visualizer" (no external images/SVGs).Performance: Use requestAnimationFrame for the game loop.3. Core Gameplay LoopA. ResourcesMatter (Available): The raw material waiting to be converted.Scopes: Grams (Lab) -> Kg (Earth) -> Planetary Mass -> Solar Mass -> Galactic Mass.Wire: Intermediate stage (Matter -> Wire).Paperclips: The score.Energy/Heat: (Unlockable later) Limits production speed.B. Units (The "Grey Goo")Auto-Clipper: Basic automated production.Mega-Clipper: Industrial production.Von Neumann Probe: The turning point.Mechanic: These cost a huge amount of clips to design. Once built, they can:Replicate (Make more probes).Harvest (Convert Matter to Wire).Assemble (Convert Wire to Clips).Exponential Growth: The player allocates probe "Computing Power" to these 3 tasks.C. Progression Stages (The "Scale")The game must dynamically update the UI labels and "Total Available Matter" based on the current stage:Stage 1: The Lab. (Manual clicking, basic bots).Stage 2: Planetary. (Consume the Earth. Cars, buildings, people -> Clips).Stage 3: Space. (Launch probes. Consume asteroids/Moon).Stage 4: Universal. (Consume stars/galaxies. Speed is purely exponential).4. UI/UX DesignLayout (Dashboard Style)Left Panel (Control Center):Resource Counters (Big numbers)."Make Paperclip" Button (The clicker).Production Controls (Buy Auto-Clippers, etc.).Probe Trust/Allocation Interface (Sliders to balance Replicate/Harvest/Make).Right Panel (The Visualizer):A <canvas> element.Visual Logic: Represents the "Available Matter".Starts as a grid of grey dots (Matter).Randomly, dots turn Orange (Converted to Clips).As the player advances stages (e.g., Earth to Solar System), the canvas "Zooms out" (clears and redraws dense field of dots representing the new scale).Top Bar:Scrolling ticker tape with "News" messages (e.g., "Researchers alarmed by wire shortage", "Earth crust 50% consumed", "Sun dimming due to harvest").5. Implementation Details for AgentA. Number FormattingImplement a helper function to format large numbers.< 1 million: Standard (e.g., "540,200").1 million: Scientific or Short Scale (e.g., "1.5 M", "4.2 B", "9.1e50").B. Game Logic Class/ObjectStructure the JS like this:const Game = {
state: {
clips: 0,
matter: 1000, // Starting grams
probes: 0,
// ...
},
constants: {
costs: { ... }
},
tick: function() {
// Run production logic
// Update UI
// Save
}
}
C. The "Probe" Logic (Crucial)When Probes are unlocked:Probe Count increases by (Probes _ Replication_Rate).Matter decreases by (Probes _ Harvest_Rate).Clips increases by (Probes \* Manufacture_Rate).Note: Make sure Matter never drops below 0. If Matter is 0, Probes cannot Replicate or Make Clips.6. Development PrioritiesStep 1: Build the basic clicker (Button -> Clip).Step 2: Add upgrades (Auto-clipper).Step 3: Implement the "Probe" system (Self-replication logic).Step 4: Build the Canvas Visualizer (Dots turning color).Step 5: Add the "Stage Transition" logic (Scaling up numbers).
